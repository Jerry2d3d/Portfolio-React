description: Create a new component using Figma, Reference Website, or Description

I can help you create a new component!

Which approach would you like to use?

**1. Figma Design**
   - Provide Figma URL, frame name, and user story
   - I'll create a pixel-perfect component from your design

**2. Reference Website**
   - Provide a URL to an existing website/component
   - I'll recreate it for your portfolio

**3. Description Only**
   - Just describe what you want
   - I'll build it from scratch based on your requirements

Which option would you prefer? (Just reply with 1, 2, or 3, or describe your choice)
