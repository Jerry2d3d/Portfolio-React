description: Add a new learning, solution, or setup guide to project knowledge base
---

I'll help you document a new learning!

**What type of learning would you like to add?**

1. **Setup Guide** - How to configure a service (Google OAuth, MongoDB, API, etc.)
2. **Problem Solution** - Bug fix or issue resolution
3. **Best Practice** - Pattern or approach that works well
4. **API Integration** - How to integrate with an external service

Please tell me:
- **Type** (1-4 from above)
- **Title** (e.g., "How to Setup SendGrid Email")
- **Details** (Steps, code, solution, etc.)
- **Should this be shared?** (Add to SHARED_LEARNINGS.md for all projects?)

I'll add it to:
- `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` (this project)
- `SHARED_LEARNINGS.md` (if you want to share)
- Create commit with your learning

**Security Reminder:** Never include actual API keys, passwords, or secrets. Use placeholders like `your_api_key_here`.
